🔍 Project Brief: BMP LSB Steganography (Encode + Decode System)

This project hides a secret file inside a BMP image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique and later extracts it using the reverse process.
Your code is well-structured with separate modules for encoding and decoding.

Let’s break it down like a human, not like a textbook. 😄

🧱 Core Idea

You take a .bmp image → hide a .txt file inside the LSBs of its pixel bytes → save it as a new “stego” BMP.
Later, you can decode the stego BMP and recover the secret file.

🛠 Main Components (Modules)
1. common.h

Defines constants like:

Magic string max length

Maximum bytes per encode chunk


2. types.h

Basic typedefs (Status, OperationType).


3. main.c

The “boss” file that:

Reads CLI arguments

Decides whether to encode or decode

Asks user for magic string

Starts processes


🔒 Encoding Workflow (encode.c)

Validate input files

Source BMP?

Secret TXT?

Output file name?

Open files and check capacity
Ensures image has enough bits to hide:

magic string

extn size (32 bits)

extn

file size (32 bits)

actual file data

Copy BMP header (54 bytes) — untouched.

Encode into LSBs:
In order:

Magic string

Secret file extension size

Secret file extension

Secret file size

Secret file data

Copy remaining image bytes.

🔓 Decoding Workflow (decode.c)

Validate stego image + output file name
Creates default name if needed.

Open stego BMP

Verify magic string
Ensures the BMP contains hidden data.

Decode in sequence:

Extension size (32 bits)

Extension

Secret file size (32 bits)

Secret file data

Write recovered data to output file.

✨ Special Features

Magic string authentication

Automatic handling of missing output filenames

Dynamic decoding of original secret file extension

Clean modular structure (encode/decode separated)

LSB handling done byte-by-byte (8 bits per character)

🧠 Why this project is cool

It teaches real file handling in C

You learn BMP structure

Bitwise operations become your best buddies

You’re literally hiding data like a hacker in movies 😎
